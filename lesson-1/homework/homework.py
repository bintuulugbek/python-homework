1 Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.
side = int(input('Give the side of square :')) 
perimeter = 4 * side area = side * side 
print(f'the perimeter of the square is {perimeter} and its area is {area}')

2 Given diameter of circle. Find its length.
diameter = int(input('Give the diameter of circle: ')) 
circleLength = 3.14 * diameter circleLength
print(circleLength)

3 Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.
a = int(input()) 
b = int(input()) 
mean = (a + b)/2 
print(mean)

4 Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.
a = int(input()) 
b = int(input()) 
sum = a + b 
product = a * b 
square1 = pow(a, 2) 
square2 = pow(b, 2) 
print(sum, product, square1, square2)
